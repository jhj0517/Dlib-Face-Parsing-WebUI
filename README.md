# Dlib Face Parsing WebUI

![Dlib Face Parsing WebUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhj0517/Dlib-Face-Parsing-WebUI/master/example/example.png)

This is Web-UI that uses the Dlib model to parse a facial image into individual parts, saves each part as a separate image, and generates a layered .tif file (which can be opened in GIMP).

If you want to see the example results, please check the `example` folder.

When opening .tif files with GIMP, make sure that "Open pages as layers" is checked!
